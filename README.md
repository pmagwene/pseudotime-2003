Code associated with Magwene et al. 2003, Bioinformatics 19(7):842-850.


# About

This is code that implements the time series reconstruction algorithms described in:

*  Magwene, P. M., P. Lizardi, and J. Kim. 2003. Reconstructing the temporal ordering of biological samples using microarray data. Bioinformatics 19(7):842-850.

Note that this code is now 18+ years old, and will need to be modified to work with recent versions of Python and associated libraries (e.g. Numpy).  Given the age of this code base, and changes to Python and associated libraries in the interim, I can not offer any support.

That said, the code base is relatively well documented and key algorithms should be relatively easy to understand from the code.
